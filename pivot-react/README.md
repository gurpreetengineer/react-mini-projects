Flexmonster is designed to integrate seamlessly with any client-side framework and can be easily embedded into your application.

This repository holds the source code for a simple [React](https://reactjs.org/) and Flexmonster Pivot Table & Charts project:

## Prerequisites

To run a simple application with the React pivot table, you will need Node.js and npm. [Get them here](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm) if they're not already installed on your machine.

## Installation

1. Download the `.zip` archive with the sample project or clone it from GitHub with the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/flexmonster/pivot-react.git && cd pivot-react
```

2. Choose one of the following projects:

    - To work with the **React+ES6** application, go to the `ES6/` folder:

    ```bash
    cd ES6
    ```

    - To see how the **React+TypeScript** application works, run the following command:

    ```bash
    cd typescript
    ```

3. Install the npm packages described in `package.json`:

```bash
npm install
```
